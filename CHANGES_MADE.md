## In pv_cell.py
- reference_bandgap_energy_temperature_coefficient included twice for both eg_ref and d_eg_dt_ref (fixed)

## In __main__.py
- Irradiance csv frame generated adds date and time column (rather than not initialising it)
- Save file name using start hour and iteration length, and then takes data from this if already generated
- Catches any unrealistic (>1e5) power generations and sets them to 0 so that true max power is found
- Generates all irradiance frames rather than just the first one in scenario list
- Generates and uses interpolation array for use in mpp calcs
